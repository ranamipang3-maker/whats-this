    <p class="introText">I've always messed up this relationship with my own when it gets fixed up and after all this I endup questioning myself "why did I do this & that blah blah" and get lost in regrets. Trust me I've never done anything knowing that will hurt you and sorry if you have suffered from anything I've done to you. I guess you have decided to break up in our last talk? I just want a last confirm if yes, say it with 'yes' to me in chat and I'll just leave all my hopes and leave from here too and if luckly it's no, chat ma 'no' bhana I'll wait till your exam ends with peaceful without talking to you cause I don't wanna mess things up right now.</p>

      <p class="introText">BTW this way of saying sorry and specially the video is kinda corny, I was just practicing web and thought of using it like this. It's not that perfect as I thought beacuse html and css ali ali aaunxa and java I done from ai help.🥀 Once try pressing button hai it's kinda cringe.😭</p>
